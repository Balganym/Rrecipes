It took a few tweaks to get it just right, I'm starting to learn that cake/cookie mixture needs to be handled in a certain way in the Thermomix to get the same results as with a mix master.Â  These cookies are delicious with a soft and chewy center and crisp outside.Â  Usually we make them with dark chocolate chips, but these ones are made using Reese's Pieces that Ty and Sam brought back for us from the USA.Â  We have a HUGE bag of them and I don't really like them for eating on their own, but they are yum to cook with!\nÂ \nFrom my blog... //tonicoward.blogspot.com/2011/07/thermomix-cooking-chocolate-chip.html"

If you find it too sticky then you can add a bit more flour until you're happy with the texture, just be carefult that you don't add too much.Â To make the handling of the dough into rolls easier I like to oil my bench and my hands a little.Â \nNotes on YeastFresh yeast is worth sourcing as it makes a big difference to the end result.Â Fresh yeast can be broken into pieces and stored in an air tight container in the freezer.Â You will know that your yeast is still active when you add the flour and sugar in the first step. If it doesn't bubble then you'll know that you need to buy new yeast.Â \nVariationsYou can add all sorts of things to the basic dough depending on what you like. Sultana's, currents, cranberries are lovely but so are milk or white chocolate chips, caramel pieces etc. Let your imagination guide you.Â \nWant to make them the day before? Try this...Â If you want them ready early in the morning you can make them the day before and then just bake them for 12minutes. Then take them out, let them cool, store in an airtight container over night.Â Then in the morning preheat your oven to 200deg again and then bake them for the last 8 minutes.Â This way you can do 99% of the work the day before but still enjoy lovely fresh HCB's first thing in the morning (and maybe even enjoy a sleep in too!!).\nOr if you have a bit more time in the morning you can do the first prove as a slow prove in the fridge over night. Follow the steps to knead the dough and then put it in a bowl and set aside to prove. At this stage cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.Â In the morning pull it out of the fridge. If you have time it's worth letting it sit on the bench for a bit to come to room temperature. I've done both methods and think I get a slightly better result if I put it on the bench for a little while first.Â Now divide into portions, roll and let prove until they are 1.5 times the size then bake.\nSpecial Thanks: A very special thanks must go to my wonderful aunt Barbara who has been making the non-thermie version of this recipe for over 30 years. I believe she got the recipe from a 1981 Womans Weekly. I converted the recipe and altered it slightly by adding more spices and fruit. She has been making these for our annual family \"bun fight\" for as long as I can remember and this day is looked forward to by our whole extended family every year.Â "

I would suggest trial in this order to see what works best for you:\nTake the egg out of the water for approx 2 minutes leave in its shell intact before cracking the egg. OR\nKeep the egg in the water once the time is up for up to a minute before cracking the egg\nEgg consistency can be quite a personal preference but you can experiment with the length of timing to get it how you like"

The TM31 result is a bit thicker than the TM5 version so add an extra 20g water if you want your sauce to be a thinner consistency. Try to resist tasting your sauce as soon as it is finished. The flavours settle a little over a few hours. Enjoy!\nÂ \n** Should last 4-6 weeks in the fridge, and 6 months in a vacuum sealed bottle in the pantry. Â Please note that the storage time is just a guide. Feel free to do your own research, and use common sense when handling homemade sauces\n** I like to separate mine into 4 portions and freeze them until required\n** Make sure you leave the MC off to allow some sauce reduction. This will give you a nice thick tomato sauce\n** When cooking for TM31, sauce will bubble slightly at the 10min mark but not enough to overflow. Sauce is contained in lid\nÂ Find more recipes and inspiration by visiting my facebook page -Â //www.facebook.com/theinspiredlittlepotÂ "

You cannot substitute the dark chocÂ \nPre prepare all other ingredients into a bowl and have eggs cracked into a seperate bowl, ready to go.\nOnce you add all ingredients together the chocolate temp will begin to lower, and start to return to a solid.\nI feel you get a much better consistency when you combine the chocolate mixture and all other ingredients into a mixing bowl and fold and combine with a spatula by hand.\nÂ \nAs per instructions in the front of the BCB, please only grate the chocolate in amounts no greater than 200gms, so for this recipe, the chocolate will need to be grated in 2 batches.\nTo keep the recipe truly gluten free, use good quality pure chocolate chips for the top of the Brookies, not compound chocolate, and a gluten free baking powder product ( Anchor Brand )\nI have made a video tutorial which you can watch here Â \n//youtu.be/zJaij74pfos\nheres the link to my face book page\n//www.facebook.com/craigsblades/ Â The NEW home of the Famous Brookie, would love for everyone to come over and say hi."

Simply thaw for forty five minutes to an hour and then roll, cut and bake. Very simple and a great snack for the lunchboxes or afternoon tea.\nThey are a nice crispy cracker too. The trick to this is having a cold dough going into the oven I have found. So if you want a super crunchy cracker, place your tray of cut out crackers into the fridge for 10-15 minutes prior to baking.\nÂ \nwww.facebook.com/theroadtolovingmythermomix\n//theroadtolovingmythermomix.blogspot.com.au"

The quiche pictured has been adapted to include cherry tomatoes, half natural yoghurt and half milk, spring onions and half a brown onion, red and green capsicum. I also regularly include a small can of corn kernels although I didn't have them in the pantry this time.Â \nTo fancy it up a little, it also looks great with thin slices of Roma tomato placed on the top of the quiche after it has been poured into the quiche dish but before placing it in the oven.\nThis is a fantastic low budget dish to take to work lunches. It is also delicious cold making it great for picnics."

Some people are having great success and others are still struggling.Â \nIf i am using jumbo size eggs I increase the time cooking eggs to 12.5 minutes.Â \nI have not tried to cook more than 2 eggs at a time.Â \nIt is okay if the water doesn't quite reach 70c in the first warm up, i have never had a problem.Â \nMost importantly, experiment, if it isn't cooked to perfection for your tastebuds/ preferences then reduce/ increase cooking time by 30seconds each time until you find your favourite consistency.Â \nDon't give up, this is such an easy way to do eggs, i do it a few times a week and i never have a fail anymore. Its no mess, no vinegars, no spraying with oil. Its just easy.\n*I use cold eggs because being in QLD i feel its too warm to leave eggs in cupboard. If you use room temp eggs, id reduce cooking time. Maybe this week ill try it with room temp eggs and give you guys a guide to work with.Â \nÂ \n**this recipe is under perfectly poached eggs for the tm31."
